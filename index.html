    <meta name="description" content="Grunt lets you automate anything. Whatever you're trying to do, there's a Grunt task for that. But sometimes it's less obvious how to combine grunt tasks to do things like run a development server with connect or integrate with TravisCI for continuous integration. This talk will take you beyond defining a simple grunt file and open your eyes to new possibilities.">

 - dymaxion house
   - from inventor bucky fuller
   - original in 1929, redesigned in 1945
   - design for a house that's interesting for a number of reasons
   - groundbreaking ideas for sustainability
   - cause he really prioritized lower water and energy usage
   - was intended to repurpose factories that made fighter planes in WWII
   - had kind of a cool futuristic look
   - successfully prototyped, orders placed for mass production
   - never happened
   - i think this is too bad
   - as i read about it, it could have really helped society
   - we would have been better off if bucky had delivered
   - but he was a textbook perfectionist, liked to iterate
 - a lot of us identify with that
   - it's may be a pain to deliver, but
   - we LOVE to build, invent, create

 - the barrier to entry
 - the breadth of stuff out there on continuous integration
  - writings:
    - martin fowler
  - software
    - jenkins server
    - teamcity server
  - services
    - travis-ci
    - circle-ci
    - shining panda
    - cloudbees
 - this can be intimidating
 - and you've already got <em>your</em> workflow
    - you've probably invested a lot of time in it
    - that's where you're most effective
    - so you don't want to have to change it
 - the thing is you don't need to know all of this stuff
 - you don't need to change your work flow
 - so let's go through a quick example
 - let's take a project that's using grunt
 - set up continuous integration with travis
   - i'm sure there are a lot of services out there
   - i've had good experiences w/ travis b/c
     - tight github integration
     - always available on irc

 - start with some goals
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>make <code>grunt test</code> work</h3>

          <aside class=notes>
 - lots of stuff for this:
   - grunt-contrib-qunit
   - grunt plugins for mocha
   - if you need a browser environment, grunt plugins for phantomjs
   - if you need a cross-browser tesging, grunt plugins for saucelabs and
     browser stack
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>add a <code>.travis.yml</code> to your repo:</h3>
          <pre><code data-trim contenteditable class=coffeescript>
language:       node_js
node_js:        ["0.10"]
before_script:  npm install -g grunt-cli
script:         grunt test
          </code></pre>

          <p>
            <a href=http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/build-configuration/>
              [docs]

            </a>
          </p>

          <aside class=notes>
 - if you're reading this, you'll notice the first line
 - language says node, but could be any environment (browser, node)
 - if it is node, specify multiple versions
 - the rest is kind of just boiler plate
 - links to docs and example

          <img src=img/travis/04_broken_build_email.png />

        <section data-background=img/travis/05_broken_build_log.png>

 - now once we push a fix...

        <section>
          <img src=img/travis/06_passing_email.png />

          <aside class=notes>
 - one email telling us everything is cool
 - and then nothing after that until things are broken again
 - that's our third goal, minimize the noise
 - last goal was some indication that merging a pull request would break things
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section data-background=img/travis/07_failing_pr.png>
          <aside class=notes>
 - so if we've got some troll that converts everything to coffee script
 - and breaks all of the unit tests
 - we can see it before doing anything

        <section>
          <img src=img/success.jpg />
          <aside class=notes>
 - so that's our four goals:
   - run tests every commit
   - e-mail when things break
   - minimal noise
   - warning if merging a pull request will cause problems
 - so that's cool and all
          </aside>

        <section data-background=img/hal.jpg>
          <aside class=notes>
 - it's kinda scary how much our boy travis knows
 - he knows:
   - when we commit
   - when that commit breaks stuff
   - and when it doesn't
   - he knows when other people try to commit
 - that's a lot
 - seems like he's holding out on us
 - wouldn't it be nice if he could just go ahead and deploy for us too?
 - of course, he can
 - let's look at an example of deploying on successful builds
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>make <code>grunt deploy</code> work</h3>

          <p>
            <a href=https://github.com/aaronj1335/shipit/blob/master/Gruntfile.js>
              [example]
            </a>
          </p>

          <aside class=notes>
 - this could also be a lot of things
 - especially since our project could range from a jquery plugin to a web app
 - there are a handful of good services for deploying:
   - heroku
   - nodejitsu
   - redhat openshift
 - in all of these cases, deploying is as simple as `git push`
 - this is a really good way of doing things
   - in terms of software engineering,
   - a lot of good ways to authenticate this that are secure, relatively convenient
   - it gives us a known state of our system
   - we know how to roll-back
 - i'm hosting these slides on github pages
 - "deploying" means copying some files to a local branch
 - so you should check out the repo
 - you can find a little 15 line example grunt task of how i did this
 - side note:
   - more often than not you don't want to go to production every commit
   - but you probably want to push good changes to a staging server
   - or maybe it's a little jquery plugin
