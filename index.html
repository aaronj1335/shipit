But sometimes it's less obvious how to combine grunt tasks to do things like run a development server with connect or integrate with TravisCI for continuous integration. This talk will take you beyond defining a simple grunt file and open your eyes to new possibilities.">

 - dymaxion house
   - from inventor bucky fuller
   - original in 1929, redesigned in 1945
   - design for a house that's interesting for a number of reasons
     - first, it had groundbreaking ideas for sustainability
       - cause he really prioritized lower water and energy usage
       - that was before a lot of people were thinking about it
     - second, was intended to repurpose factories that made fighter planes in WWII
     - third and most importantly, people thought it looked cool
   - successfully prototyped, orders placed for mass production
   - but i bet you've never seen one of these around town
   - that's because bucky never shipped this to production
 - a lot of us identify with how hard that is
   - we LOVE to build, invent, create

   - test.html, test_one_thing.js, test_another.js
   - open it up, no dice (doesn't load successfully or there are failing tests)
   - check commit logs, last commit 2 decades ago
   - SO, at one point somebody did the right thing
   - BUT it never became a regular thing, never integrated into the process

 - a lot of organizations have a lot of tribal knowledge
 - you ask what the release process is
 - and the answer is something like
   - "you go to devops bill"
   - "and he's the one with the password to the ftp server"
   - "so you give him a tarball"
   - etc
 - two problems:
 - we all suffer from fat fingers sometimes

 - and you've already got <em>your</em> workflow

 - the thing is you don't need to know all of this stuff

 - so let's go through a quick example
 - let's take a project that's using grunt
 - set up continuous integration with travis

          <aside class=notes>
 - this could also be a lot of things
 - especially since our project could range from a jquery plugin to a web app
 - there are a handful of good services for deploying:
   - heroku
   - nodejitsu
   - redhat openshift
 - in all of these cases, deploying is as simple as `git push`
 - this is a really good way of doing things
   - in terms of software engineering,
   - a lot of good ways to authenticate this that are secure, relatively convenient
   - it gives us a known state of our system
   - we know how to roll-back
 - i'm hosting these slides on github pages
 - "deploying" means copying some files to a local branch
 - so you should check out the repo
 - you can find a little 15 line example grunt task of how i did this
 - side note:
   - more often than not you don't want to go to production every commit
   - but you probably want to push good changes to a staging server
   - or maybe it's a little jquery plugin

          <aside class=notes>
 - you can see our grunt deploy command
 - then some security stuff
 - that can be tricky and a bit scary, so let's talk about that

            <li>
              <a href="https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens">
                github api token
              </a>
            </li>
            <li class=fragment>
              <a href="http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/build-configuration/#Secure-environment-variables">
                secure variables for travis
              </a>
            </li>
            <li class=fragment>
              no one can get the password except travis
              <span class=fragment>(&hellip; and the nsa)</span>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <aside class=notes>
 - that token is a special password from github
 - it can be used to push to your repos
 - but you can revoke it at any time
 - if you change ci services or something gets hacked
 - but we don't want commit it in plain text to the repo
 - then we encrypt it using a service from travis
 - and then the only people that can read it are travs (and the nsa)
 - but this achieves our goal

        <section data-background=img/success.png>
          <aside class=notes>
 - with relatively little effort
 - in short amount of time
 - we've set up some powerful tools
 - that let us know when something breaks our project
 - and act as a gatekeeper and automatically deploy good changes
 - and that's going to help us ship

            busy people  <span class=red>❤</span> this
          </h2>
          <h2 class=fragment>
            teams  <span class=red>❤</span> this

          <h2 class=fragment>
            everybody <span class=red>#winning</span>
          </h2>

          <aside class=notes>
 - busy people love this because it's so efficient
 - it makes you more productive
 - teams love this, whether you're:
   - developer and you don't want to look bad because your stuff breaks
   - qa or tester and you want to maintain a high level of quality
   - project manager and you want to ship on schedule
 - everybody wins
 - and if you implement something like this it gives you the chance to be the
   hero

          <aside class=notes>
 - i hope i'm not the only one who looks at that picture and sees a hero
 - anyway that's everything i wanted to go over
 - we've got a little bit of time
